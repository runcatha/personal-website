            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Full-stack Web Developer who gained a passion for problem solving and working in teams/with clients from my time in veterinary care and Air Force ROTC.
                <br />
                For medical reasons, I am transitioning out of a military career and using that time spent developing leadership, public speaking, and attention to detail to better myself as an engineer.
                <br />
                I love using the skills Iâ€™ve learned to solve problems and contribute to a team.
