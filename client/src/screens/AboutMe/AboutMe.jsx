      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Full-stack Web Developer who gained a passion for problem solving and working in teams/with clients from my time in veterinary care and Air Force ROTC.
          <br />
          For medical reasons, I am transitioning out of a military career and using that time spent developing leadership, public speaking, and attention to detail to better myself as an engineer.
          <br />
          I love using the skills Iâ€™ve learned to solve problems and contribute to a team.
